# Pixel Quest Productivity App Implementation Plan

An interactive todo application with a retro gamified twist. Manage tasks as quests, earn XP, level up, and unlock pixel art companions.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
- Initialize a Vite + React project in `/Users/pranjal/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/pixel-quest`.
- Use Vanilla CSS for all styling to achieve a retro "8-bit" look with modern glassmorphism.

### Components
- `QuestList`: Main container for quests.
- `QuestItem`: Individual quest card with animations.
- `LevelProgress`: Header component showing XP and Level.
- `PetGallery`: Display area for unlocked pixel pets.
- `QuestForm`: Modern overlay to add new quests.

### Data Model (Firestore)
- `quests`: Collection of quest objects `{ id, title, description, difficulty, completed, timestamp }`.
- `userProgress`: Document tracking `{ totalXP, level, unlockedPets }`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- No unit tests planned for this prototype, focusing on visual and functional verification.

### Manual Verification
- Use the browser tool to interact with the app.
- Verify quest creation and completion.
- Verify XP calculation and level-up logic.
- Verify data persistence via Firestore.
